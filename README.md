Ruby raytracer

Written in Ruby 2.7 thanks largely to the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley.

Outputs to .ppm format (you'll need something like [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) to view the files).

## Generate Your Own:

Clone this repository, then:

```shell
ruby main.py
```

It'll generate a new timestamped render in the `images` directory.
